# Basic Python
## 1. Data Types:-
### i. Containers
Containers are any object that holds an arbitrary number of other objects. Generally, containers provide a way to access the contained objects and to iterate over them.

In the collections there are some container datatypes, which are alternatives to python’s general purpose built-in containers like dict, list, set etc.

Some of the containers are:

**1) namedtuple():**
Used to create tuple subclass with the name field
**2) deque:**
Queue using list type data
**3) Counter:**
Subclass of dict to count the hash-table objects
**4) ChainMap:**
Used to create single view of multiple mappings
**5) OrderedDict**
Subclass of dict, where data are added in ordered manner
**6) UserList**
Wrapper for list to easier access.
