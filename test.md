# Basic Python
## 1. Data Types:-
### i) Containers
Containers are any object that holds an arbitrary number of other objects. Generally, containers provide a way to access the contained objects and to iterate over them.

In the collections there are some container datatypes, which are alternatives to pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers like dict, list, set etc.
Some of the containers are:

**1) namedtuple()**
Used to create tuple subclass with the name field

**2) deque**
Queue using list type data
